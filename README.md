# Cryptography Learning Repository

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms and protocols, organized from foundational concepts to advanced applications. The code is meant for learning purposes and should not be used in production environments.

## üîë Foundational Cryptography

### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- Digital signature scheme using public-key cryptography
- Based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers
- Implementation demonstrates key generation, signing, and verification
- [View Implementation](rsa.py)

### ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
- Digital signature scheme using elliptic curve cryptography
- More efficient than RSA with smaller key sizes
- Uses the secp192r1 curve for demonstrations
- [View Implementation](ecdsa.py)

### Schnorr Signatures
- Simple and efficient signature scheme
- Provides native multi-signature support
- Linear signature verification
- [View Implementation](schnorr.py)

## üöÄ Advanced Cryptography

### Paillier Cryptosystem
- Homomorphic encryption scheme
- Allows computation on encrypted data
- Supports addition of encrypted values
- [View Implementation](paillier.py)

### MuSig (Multi-Signature Scheme)
- Advanced multi-signature scheme using Schnorr signatures
- More efficient than individual signatures
- Non-interactive signature aggregation
- [View Implementation](musig.py)

## üí´ Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Applications

### IoT Temperature Averaging
- Privacy-preserving temperature aggregation
- Uses Paillier homomorphic encryption
- Demonstrates practical MPC use case
- [View Implementation](iot_temperature_average_mpc.py)

### Dynamic Consortium Key Management
- Threshold signature scheme for consortiums
- Handles dynamic member joining/leaving
- Maintains shared signing capabilities
- [View Implementation](dynamic_consortium_keys.py)
